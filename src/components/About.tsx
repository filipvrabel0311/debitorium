      <h2>About Us</h2>
      <p>Debitorium is a small, independent software studio.</p>
      <p>
        We launch focused, infrastructure-level products that unlock access to
        communication, credit, and information. Our tools are global-first, lean
        by design, and built to last.
      </p>
      <p>
        Today, that means Hertzra. Tomorrow, it could mean smarter debt data,
        AI-powered public finance tools, or better access to the analog world.
      </p>
      <p>We go deep. Then we ship.</p>
